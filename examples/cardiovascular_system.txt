The human heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It is divided into four chambers: the left atrium, right atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle.

The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the body's tissues. Veins return oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart.

The coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle itself. Coronary artery disease occurs when these arteries become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to angina or heart attack.

High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is a major risk factor for heart disease. Cholesterol buildup in arteries can cause atherosclerosis, which narrows blood vessels and restricts blood flow.

Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress management can help prevent cardiovascular disease. Medications like statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors are commonly prescribed to treat heart conditions.
